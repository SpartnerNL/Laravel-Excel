# Laravel Excel

- Use `maatwebsite/excel` for spreadsheet exports, imports, queued spreadsheet work, CSV handling, and PhpSpreadsheet integration in Laravel applications.
- Prefer explicit export/import classes with package concerns over ad-hoc spreadsheet generation in controllers, jobs, or commands.
- Activate the `laravel-excel` skill when working with `Excel::download()`, `Excel::store()`, `Excel::queue()`, `Excel::raw()`, `Excel::import()`, `Excel::toArray()`, `Excel::toCollection()`, export/import concerns, queued imports/exports, validation, CSV settings, styling, multiple sheets, or `Excel::fake()`.
- For large datasets, prefer `FromQuery` with queued exports or `WithChunkReading` and `WithBatchInserts` for imports.
- Test spreadsheet behavior with `Excel::fake()` when asserting dispatch/download/store/import intent, and inspect generated files only when cell contents, formatting, sheets, or writer behavior must be proven.
