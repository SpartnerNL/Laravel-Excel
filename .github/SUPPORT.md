# Support

This repository is focused on bugs and issues. We unfortunately can't answer all support questions in a timely manner. Our software is free and open source, meaning that the use of our software is optional.
We hold no liability and there is no obligation to support. We will provide support on a best effort basis.

If you use the software commercially and need elaborate support or need it urgently, we can offer this on a commercial basis. 
Please contact info@maatwebsite.nl or via phone +31 (0)10 744 9312 or visit the dedicated page with more information:
